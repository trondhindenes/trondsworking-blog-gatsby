description: About moving this site to Gatsby

I'm moving this site to a new platform, built using Gatsby <https://www.gatsbyjs.org/> and hosted on Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>. I'm still running it behind Cloudflare, mostly because cloudflare has free DNS hosting for my domain.

I was running on Wordpress for a number of years, but it was slow and expensive (especially since I don't write that much). Then I tried Jekyll on Github Pages for a while, but I never really liked Jekyll (especially since I'm not a Ruby dev).

Next I started putting a few posts on Medium but I don't like their paywalling.

So we'll see how this goes. Hopefully I can start sharing more posts now that I have a well-working platform.
